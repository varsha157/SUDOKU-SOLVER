# SUDOKU SOLVER USING MULTIPLE ALGORITHMS AND COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS FOR VARIABLE DIFFICULTY LEVELS

This work focuses on traditional and regular 9x9 board sudoku, and a comparison is made between the paper-and-pencil method and the brute force algorithmic programme. To resolve the puzzle, many alternative algorithms such as simplex, backtracking, dancing Knuth's method, and genetic approach are also used. The efficiency of these algorithms is further investigated by evaluating the time and space complexity for various difficulty levels in order to get the most optimum sudoku solution.
